# spanish-verb-conjugator 


In the book Spanish Irregular Verbs Up Close of the McGraw Hill series Practice Makes Perfect, Dr. Eric Vogt lays out a simplified system for conjugating Spanish verbs. This repository is an attempt to codify those rules in that system into Python so that one can generate the verb conjugations from inserting the infinitive form. This is intentionally done without the use of any AI and is relying on pure logic representing the conjugation rules and reference data containing 6 forms of each verb -- first person singular present, second person singular present, the infinitive, first person singular preterite, gerund and past participle. 

I have created this project as a way to help myself understand Spanish verbs better, but I have made it public in the event that thinking about it in this way is useful to anyone else who is learning Spanish. If you find an issue with it, please let me know. I obviously don't own the Spanish language, and I did not come up with these rules of conjugation, but I did write all the Python.  
Gracias por visitar mi repo. 


##TO DO 
- preterite 
- irregular stems in preterit use different endings (how to deal with that in context of this code) 
- future 
- conditional 
- present subjunctive 
- imperfect subjunctive 
- imperatives 
    - may also get tricky bc of different NO / positive forms and irregularity of some verbs 
- Compound Tenses 
    - indicative perfect (he caracterizado) -- haber (presente) + past participle
    - pluscuamperfecto de indicativo (había caracterizado) -- haber (imperfecto) + past participle 
    - anterior préterito (hube caracterizado)  -- haber (préterito) + past participle 
    - future perfect (habré caracterizado) -- haber (future) + past participle 
    - potencial compuesto (habría caracterizado) -- haber (conditional) + past participle 
    - perfecto de subjuntivo (haya caracterizado) -- haber (subjunctive present) + past participle 
    - pluscuamperfecto de subjuntivo 1 (hubiese caracterizado) -- haber (imperfecto subjuntivo) + past participle
